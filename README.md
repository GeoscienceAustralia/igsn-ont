# IGSN-O
This repository contains the International Geo Sample Number's OWL ontology and some reference material.

See the ontology's definition at it's namespace location:

[http://pid.geoscience.gov.au/def/ont/igsn](http://pid.geoscience.gov.au/def/ont/igsn)

An image of the required classes and properties for each ontology instance (i.e. the description of a particular sample according to the ontology) is given in [igsn.png](igsn.png).

## Examples
A sample (igsn:AU2648696) is exported from the Geoscience Australia Samples database in XML as per [Sample e.g. 1 XML](examples/sample_eg1.xml). The IGSN ontology version of that sample is given in [Sample e.g. 1 IGSN ontology turtle RDF file](examples/sample_eg1.ttl).
